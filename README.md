# GEQ1917_Water_Alarm_Timer

This water alarm timer was implemented as part of a sustainability project targeted at reducing shower time. By displaying a running timer for users as they showered and having an
alarm ring after a certain alloted duration, it enabled users to be more conscious of their shower duration, and be incentivised to cut down their shower duration.

Within the 2 week implementation period in the Tower Block of Ridge View Residential College, a 27% total average reduction in shower duration was achieved.
